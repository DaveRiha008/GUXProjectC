Logs captured by the game are stored in a directory of the game /Projec_C_Data/LabelsLogs
The logs are saved in .txt files
Every log has a name containing the date and time, when the according game was started

The format of logs is unstructured, but it contains the following info:

There is dynamically written information:
Everytime an item is bought from the shop, the logs capture it (A line saying which item was bought)
Everytime the player interacts with something for the first time, the logs capture it (A line saying with which interactable)

And there is information written at the game termination:
When the game is terminated, the logs capture the overall time spent on each screen described by its unique ID (for screen IDs see ScreenIDs.png)
When the game is terminated, the logs capture the overall count of coins collected for each type (based on their rarity)
